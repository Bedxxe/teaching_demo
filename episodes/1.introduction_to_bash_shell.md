There are different ways in which we can interact with computers such as touch screens, by voice commands, or through a mouse and keyboard. Until now, the most widely used is using a graphical user interface (GUI). Another way to interact with a computer is using a command-line interface (CLI). 

A <kbd>shell</kbd> is program that manages the user-system interaction by prompting users for inputs, interpreting their input, and giving an output from the underlying operating system.

## The Unix Shell

While a GUI presents to the user with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically present, we will need to call them! we need to learn the names of the programs we want to invoke and the grammar to tell them what we want them to do. 

When a shell window is opened, you are presented with a prompt: `$` . the shell is waiting for your to command, is waiting for an input.

 
~~~
computer@user$
~~~
{: .language-bash}

After you type a command, you need to press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute it. We will use our fist command:  

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}


~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

Commands take the form of acronyms or abbreviations of actions. The command `ls` stands for enlist what is inside the folder where we are located. 

> ### Command not found
> If the shell can't find a program whose name is the command you typed, it
> will print an error message such as:
>
> ~~~
> $ enlist
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> ~~~
> enlist: command not found
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> This might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command
> is not installed.
{: .callout}


We can combine commands with **options**. Options are the `-` character and letters, they are usually called flags. We will use the `-F ` option to tell `ls` to classify the contents of the directory so we can know what they are:

* `/` this trailing is for directories
* `*` is used for executables

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}


~~~
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/
~~~
{: .output}

In this example output we can see that there are some sub-directories inside this folder. Names that do not have a classification symbol are **files** in the current directory.

### Asking for help

The `ls` command has many options. There are two practical ways to find out how to use a command and the options that come along side with it.

1. Using the `--help` option to the command:
~~~
$ ls --help
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if neither -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options, too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries
...        ...        ...
~~~
{: .output}


2. Searching for help in the internet.

### Where I am? Ask what is your current position in your computer

We can use the `pwd` command (Print Working Directory), to ask the Shell our location in our computer:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
$ /Users/bedxx
~~~
{: .output}

Here, the computer's response is `/Users/bedxx` which is where I am now in my computer. the structure of my system will be as follows:

(../figures/folder_structure.png)

At the top of of the diagram, we found the **root directory** that holds everything else. The **root directory** is represented with `/`. This character is the leading slash in the answer that we got before from `pwd`: `/Users/bedxx`.

Now we can see in this example that our current directory `/Users/bedxx` is stored inside `/Users`. Similarly, we can see that `/Users` is inside the **root directory** `/`. Underneath `/Users`, we can find one directory for each user that has an account on our computer:

(../figures/users_folder_structure.png)


### Going beyond here: Exploring other directories

Communication can be difficult. To be more clear on what we want, we can use **arguments** alongside the commands. **Arguments** are separated by a space from the command and the options. Let's use the `Documents` argument to enlist what is inside this sub-directory.

~~~
$ ls -F Documents
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
folderA/ folderB/ fileA.txt fileB.txt
~~~
{: .output}

The Bash shell depends on that the files are organized in a hierarchical way. we can continue going deeper into our sub-directories adding content to the **argument** given to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls -F Documents/folderA
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
tableA.tsv tableB.tsv
~~~
{: .output}

### Enjoy the journey: Moving to a different directory

We can change our location using the command `cd` (change directory), followed by a directory name to which we want to move to. This command is similar than double-clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into that folder. 

Let's say we want to move to the `folderA` from the above example with `ls`. We can use the next set of commands:

~~~
$ cd Documents
$ cd folderA
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now, if we ask for our current working directory, we will get a different answer than before:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/bedxx/Documents/folderA
~~~
{: .output}

We have learned how to move "down" into a sub-directory, but how we go "up" in the directory tree (_i.e._ to the **parental directory**). We can try with the next command:

~~~
$ cd Documents
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory
~~~
{: .error}

`cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are different ways to see directories above our current location. 

#### The .. directory
There is a special directory name meaning the **parent** directory of the current directory: `..` If we do the new command, we can go up in the directory tree:

~~~
$ cd ..
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/bedxx/Documents
~~~
{: .output}

#### Using an absolute path

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using **relative paths**. When you use a relative path with a command like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/bedxx/Documents
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cd /Users/bedxx
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/bedxx
~~~
{: .output}
